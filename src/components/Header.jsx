      <p>
        I'm an Frontend Developer and Web Developer, 
        developing my version of the digital world one step at a time. 
        All my projects are build from scratch,
        from planning and designing to solving problems with code.
        Coding takes me into a new world that i can grasp on, a new journey to
        take on, a new path to help people in their digital life, thats why i love 
        to Code.
